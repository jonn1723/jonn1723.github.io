I'm currently enrolled in the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate and wanted to consolidate what I've learnt so far by doing a hands-on project. This dashboard helps visualize the crucial KPIs commonly generated in a customer care setting by the company's Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system and their Customer Service Representatives (CSR).

The raw call center data contains 1000 datapoints and was generated by ChatGPT to be between a 6-month interval with each call having its own unique call ID. KPIs included are:
1. IVR to CSR Time: How long it takes for the IVR system to accurately direct a call to the appropriate CSR
2. CSR Resolution Time: How long it takes for the CSR to resolve the request
3. Start and End Time: When the call started, and when it ended - summation of the previous two measures
4. Request Type: Self-explanatory

This data was then imported into PowerBI by clicking "Get Data" while Power Query, along with new measures created using Data Analysis Expression (DAX) transformed and manipulated the data for visualization usage:

1. Add column from example to have a respective number for each month:
PowerBI currently isn't able to sort chronologically by month; therefore, we need a corresponding number for each month and sort by that instead. The add column from example function allows us to easily implement this by providing a few examples our new column in respects to the selected column. For example, if I put 7 for July, 8 for August, and so on, PowerBI will recognize this pattern and autofill the remainder of the column for me.

2. Summing IVR to CSR time & CSR Resolution time for total End-to-End (ETE) duration:

3. Dividing all time measures by 60 to get minutes for better interpretability:

4. Rounding all time measures (in minutes) to 1-decimal point for visibility:

5. Adding conditional columns - if call duration below threshold, then "Yes", if exceeds threshold, then "No":
Spending too long interacting with the IVR system will increase customer dissatisfaction while long calls with the CSR will cost the company potential revenue. Therefore, I set an arbitrary threshold for both the aforementioned measures and the ETE time.

6. Counting distinct calls per month:

7. Averaging each KPI measure by month:

Using a combination of a line & stacked column chart and a donut chart, the final dashboard looks like this:

The line chart displays the average respective KPI for that month while the stacked bar chart indicates the total amount of calls that month, and how many calls exceeded or within the threshold.

The slicer located in the "Request Type Breakdown" chart is a dropdown that allows for filtering by month. For each request type, we can also see the average time needed for the CSR to resolve the request.

That's it for my project for now! As I continue to learn, I'll be updating or creating new dashboard to help consolidate what I learnt in the course. Any suggestions or feedback would be highly appreciated!

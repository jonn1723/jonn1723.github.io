I'm currently enrolled in the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate and wanted to consolidate what I've learnt so far by doing a hands-on project. This dashboard helps visualize the crucial KPIs commonly generated in a customer care setting by the company's Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system and their Customer Service Representatives (CSR).

The raw call center data was generated by ChatGPT to be between a 6-month interval with each call having its own unique call ID and included other KPIs such as:
1. IVR to CSR Time: How long it takes for the IVR system to accurately direct a call to the appropriate CSR
2. CSR Resolution Time: How long it takes for the CSR to resolve the request
3. Start and End Time: When the call started, and when it ended - summation of the previous two measures
4. Request Type: Self-explanatory

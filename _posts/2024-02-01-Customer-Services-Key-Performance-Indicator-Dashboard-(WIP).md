I'm currently enrolled in the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate and wanted to consolidate what I've learnt so far by doing a hands-on project. This dashboard helps visualize the crucial KPIs commonly generated in a customer care setting by the company's Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system and their Customer Service Representatives (CSR).

The raw call center data contains 1000 datapoints and was generated by ChatGPT to be between a 6-month interval with each call having its own unique call ID. KPIs included are:
1. IVR to CSR Time: How long it takes for the IVR system to accurately direct a call to the appropriate CSR
2. CSR Resolution Time: How long it takes for the CSR to resolve the request
3. Start and End Time: When the call started, and when it ended - summation of the previous two measures
4. Request Type: Self-explanatory

This data was then imported into PowerBI by clicking "Get Data" while Power Query was subsequently used to transform and manipulate the data for visualization usage:
1. Add column from example to have a respective number for each month - PowerBI currently isn't able to sort chronologically by month; therefore, we need a corresponding number for each month and sort by that instead. The add column from example function allows us to easily implement this by providing a few examples our new column in respects to the selected column. For example, if I put 7 for July, 8 for August, and so on, PowerBI will recognize this pattern and autofill the remainder of the column for me.

The diet optimization project successfully demonstrates the application of linear programming to solve one of the earliest large-scale optimization problems studied in practice. By leveraging the PuLP library, we formulated and solved a diet problem aimed at minimizing the cost while meeting the nutritional requirements for soldiers. The problem involved selecting a combination of food items to meet specified dietary constraints, such as minimum and maximum levels of calories, cholesterol, fat, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, protein, vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. While not entirely feasible or practical, I added various other constraints attempting to create a diet that is both nutritious and delicious!

First, after selecting the first 65 rows of the data frame, we convert it into a list for immediate use. Each food in the list is then mapped to its respective cost and nutrient dictionaries while “dmin” and “dmax” are the minimum and maximum nutritional values respectively required to statisfy a healthy diet. Meanwhile, “food_vars” represents the quantity of each food item, but when initialized, only displays values of zero or higher. Lastly, the objective function is the total cost of selected foods which the model attempts to minimize when solving.

An issue we can address immediately is having 0.1 servings of eggs or 0.25 servings of brocolli which would be difficult to serve efficiently. Therefore, I limited the minimum serving of each food to 0.5 - a much more reasonable serving to split if required. Another constraint we could consider is to limit between only celery or broccoli as those are two of the most disliked vegetables! To create this overall constraint, we need two constraints. The first constraint demands that each serving must be at least 0.5 of a whole serving while the second constraint ensures that only selected foods are included in the solution. Next, the second constraint is fairly easy to implement. Since we only want one of either celery or frozen broccoli to be selected, the sum of these two can only be equal to one or better yet, none. Here are the results:

Lastly, to ensure protein variety, I made a list of what I considered proteins at a glance when skimming the Excel spreadsheet. The optimizer then picks at least three of these meats from the list.

One notable observation of interest is that the computational time seems to increase exponentially as more constraints are added. This behavior is characteristic of many optimization problems, where the complexity of the solution space grows with the number of constraints. We can also infer a few things from looking at the solutions itself. Raw celery and iceberg lettuce seem to have the highest nutrients to cost ratio and are overused in every single solution. A more meaningful constraint might be to limit between celery and iceberg lettuce, since only ¼ servings of broccoli were used in the initial optimization solution. I was surprised to see air-popped popcorn on the list with over 13 servings in each solution. I’ve always thought of popcorn to be unhealthy, but that just seems to be popular prejudice due to the butter drizzled onto it. Even without the butter, I would’ve thought the nutrition levels would be similar to rice or bread. However, popcorn actually provides protein as well, and that is why even in part c, only the minimum amount of mean (protein) were included in the optimal solutino. I was initially surprised at how the low the cost of part c was until I found out popcorn provided proteins as well. One last interesting thing to note, the solution for part c, which includes previous constraints as well, happens to include peanut butter. As someone who ate ants-on-a-stick growing up, part c’s solution doesn’t seem to be as horrible as its contenders. 

For potential follow-ups, we might want to quantify our results in a more meaningful manner; that is, instead of having decimal points of servings, we might want to restrict our results to whole or half servings instead. This can easily be performed by changing the constraint in part A. Similarly, for each food type, we can include an upper bound of servings since 53 servings of celery and 64 servings of raw iceberg lettuce doesn’t seem like a feasible, long-term diet. Even for vegetarians, this diet would likely not be very appetizing and be left unfinished, leading to malnutrition. In short, follow-up solutions should consider whole or half portions only, while considering the feasibility/practicality of the diet.

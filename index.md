Hi, My name is Jonathan and I'm looking to transition from biotechnology into the data analytics field and eventually to a software engineer!
This is a blog documenting the skills I've learnt so far in my journey transitioning into analytics and tech.

I've chosen to document my projects in a blog format so I can come back from time to time to go through the logic behind what I've written, and have a refresher on what I've learnt.

Edit: Hard work pays off - I've landed by first job outside the lab as a data analyst!

Edit 2: Hard work pays off but luck also helps! Positions opened up since the parent company was looking to build a new team to build an internal CRM
